    **Veritas One represents a paradigm shift in patient data ownership** by enabling individuals to aggregate, access, and monetize their health records.  
    Currently, electronic health record (EHR) fragmentation remains a substantial barrier to coordinated care, patient autonomy, and equitable data monetization.  
    Despite health data being a multi-billion-dollar industry, patients lack direct control over their own information and receive no financial benefit from its use in research or advertising.

    ### **Our platform directly addresses these challenges by:**
    - **Providing a centralized patient-controlled health record** that integrates structured FHIR-based EHR data, faxed documents, and DICOM imaging.
    - **Offering a transparent compensation model** where patients can opt to share de-identified data for research or identifiable data for targeted health-related advertising, ensuring ethical and controlled monetization.
    - **Empowering patients** to reduce redundant tests, enhance care coordination, and facilitate second opinions, ultimately reducing healthcare inefficiencies and improving outcomes.

    **At Veritas One, you own your health data, you control its use, and you benefit from it.**

    At Veritas One, we use a **two-database system** to keep your identifiable and de-identified data separate. This ensures your privacy while still allowing you to benefit from data sharing.

    **1. Your Identifiable Data (Stored in a Secure Personal Health Record)**
    - **What it includes:** Your name, date of birth, medical history, lab results, provider notes, imaging, medications, and other personal health records.
    - **Where it‚Äôs stored:** In a secure, HIPAA-compliant personal health record that only you can access and share.
    - **Who can see it?** Only you, and anyone you explicitly choose to share it with.

    **2. Your De-Identified Data (Used for Medical Research & Insights)**
    - **What it includes:** Medical conditions, treatments, lab values, imaging findings‚Äîbut with all personal identifiers removed (no name, date of birth, or anything traceable back to you).
    - **Where it‚Äôs stored:** In a separate research database used to improve medicine, public health, and clinical care.
    - **Who can see it?** Researchers and healthcare analysts, but they will never see your name, contact information, or anything that could identify you.
