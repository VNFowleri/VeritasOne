    **Veritas One represents a paradigm shift in patient data ownership** by enabling individuals to aggregate, access, and monetize their health records.  
    Currently, electronic health record (EHR) fragmentation remains a substantial barrier to coordinated care, patient autonomy, and equitable data monetization.  
    Despite health data being a multi-billion-dollar industry, patients lack direct control over their own information and receive no financial benefit from its use in research or advertising.

    ### **Our platform directly addresses these challenges by:**
    - **Providing a centralized patient-controlled health record** that integrates structured FHIR-based EHR data, faxed documents, and DICOM imaging.
    - **Offering a transparent compensation model** where patients can opt to share de-identified data for research or identifiable data for targeted health-related advertising, ensuring ethical and controlled monetization.
    - **Empowering patients** to reduce redundant tests, enhance care coordination, and facilitate second opinions, ultimately reducing healthcare inefficiencies and improving outcomes.

    **At Veritas One, you own your health data, you control its use, and you benefit from it.**
